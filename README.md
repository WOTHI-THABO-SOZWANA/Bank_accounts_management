Customer &amp; Employee Impact Analysis


Objective:
    To evaluate customer value distribution and employee transactional performance using relational database insights—connecting relationships across customers, accounts, employees, transactions, and reports.

Key Business Questions:
    This project explores how data can answer practical, business-oriented questions:
    Which customers hold the highest account balances—and what types of accounts do they prefer?
    Which employees are responsible for the most impactful transactions?
    Are high-value customers concentrated in specific regions or cities?

Data Structure Overview:
  The relational database consists of the following key tables:
    
  2.1 Accounts
    Identify customers with the highest and lowest balances.
    Classify account types associated with each customer.
    Aggregate balances by account type.

  2.2 Customers
    Discover the most common first names and surnames.
    Pinpoint the oldest and most recently added customers.
    Group customers by birth month.
    Cluster customers by city of residence.

  2.3 Employees
    Count how many employees hold each unique position.

  2.4 Reports
    Determine how many reports include the keywords "SALES" or "ANALYSIS."
    Analyze how many reports were created per month.

  2.5 Transactions
    Count the number of unique transaction types.
    Reveal the transaction with the highest amount and its date.
    Find the oldest and most recent transactions recorded.

Analytical Highlights:
  This project applies SQL techniques such as:
    Subqueries
    Aggregate functions
    Conditional filtering and grouping

Each query is documented and structured to allow replicability with mock or real datasets, making the case study suitable for learning, collaboration, or contribution.
